    <br>
        <p>MotorShop is an application that allows the registration and management of regular users and car sellers. Sellers can create car ads for sale and manage their ads through a control panel. Users can register, buy available cars, visit the seller’s profile, and view detailed information about each ad, including description, photos, values, and comments. The home page displays cars recently added by sellers and offers various search filters.</p>
